## Questions & Contributions

The web is vast and technologies change all the time! This project once was a
frontend in Angular talking to a RESTful API written in php. Then a Apollo React frontend talking to a GraphQL backend! It's all in the version history üòÅ

Feel free to ask why a feature is implemented in a particular way, or push "Best
Practices" and request neat features!

## Coding Challenges

This repo also houses [jmagrippis‚Äô Coding Challenges]! Visit the index, find one you like, and give it a whirl!

### Prep

You will need the version of Node specified in the `.nvmrc` installed: it is recommended to use [nvm] for hassle-free node version management, and simply running `nvm i` at the project root.

[Yarn v1] is recommended for installing this project's dependencies. [npm] which would have been installed alongside node should work almost just as well.

Assuming you went with yarn, go to the root of the project and run:

```sh
yarn
```

... and everything you need to run this project and its tests will be downloaded for you. Prep complete!

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm 'bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions'
[yarn v1]: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install 'because they dropped the ball with v2'
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/ 'it once was THE javascript package manager'

### Starting the dev server

If you clone this project and go to the root directory, running:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Will spin up the dev server, running on port 3500. For example, visiting http://localhost:3500/coding-challenges/2020/cycling-element would get you to the spec for the Cycling Element challenge, and http://localhost:3500/coding-challenges/2020/cycling-element/playground where you could be trying to fulfil the spec.

### Running tests

Regardless if you‚Äôve got the server running, the following command will start the test runner:

```sh
yarn test --watch
```

Tests will rerun when any code changes, so you may start adding `MyComponent.test.tsx` files with expectations and see turn from red to green as you fulfill the spec.

The testing framework of choice is [Jest] and [React Testing Library] is also setup, and heavily recommended for the UI testing.

[jest]: https://jestjs.io/ 'testing framework with a focus on simplicity'
[react testing library]: https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro 'builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components'

### Running e2e tests

For these you **will** need the server running at http://localhost:3500/.

We're using [Cypress] to ensure the app "actually works"‚Ñ¢ in production, and to follow BDD with responsive-design and accessibility in mind.

Responsive design especially, is tricky to meaningfully test using the Jest tests from the previous section. In contrast, edge-cases, mutating / destructive scenarios are trickier to test e2e and it's where the Jest tests shine!

My blogpost on [BDD and E2E testing a responsive web app] sums up how I set up a very similar config during live-streams on [Twitch] üôÇ

In any case, to develop the app with the tests running side-by-side to the browser using the Cypress Dashboard, run:

```sh
yarn bdd
```

Our automated tests that run against deployments are defined in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`. They essentially run the following command, only visiting the deployment url instead of the local server:

```sh
yarn e2e
```
