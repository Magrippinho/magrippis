          Should your brand be focused? That’s the increasingly trending advice
          and it does give businesses a higher chance of success.

          But humans are complicated creatures and I refuse to take one of my
          many interests to the extreme and reduce “my brand” to one easily
          digestible bit.

        <p className="mb-2">
          I’m not going to choose between creating content exclusively for
          landscape photography, or for 4X strategy video games, or for
          practicing handstands. I’m not gonna create a “Frontend specialist”
          brand, to complement the “evangelising GraphQL” brand, while promoting
          the "career-change mentoring" brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brand is going to be me and all the things I fancy at any time! So,
          get in touch if you are interested in any particular aspect, or you
          too want to be successful, while still showcasing your complex,
          fascinating self 😄
