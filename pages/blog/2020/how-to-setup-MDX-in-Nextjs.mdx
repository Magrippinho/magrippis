## The what

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ 'if you thought this page loaded fast, they‚Äôre part of the why!') is a framework for isomoprhic React apps. It makes it easy to write blazing fast websites, by rendering them on the server first for a speed and SEO boost. The client takes over after, to get the seamless UX of a Single Page App.

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ 'maybe the wikipedia article would be more informative, but it‚Äôs always nice to link the source') is a minimal markup language. It makes it easy to write!

**HTML**, the most famous markup language for instance, renders beautifully but is hard to read in raw form‚Ä¶ **Markdown** however, may be parsed into HTML for your browser to render just as beautifully, but even when you see it raw through your human eyeballs, you can tell what is a title, what is a list, what is emphasised‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just brilliant, and it‚Äôs especially popular with developers.

Its popularity has not stopped there however: [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/ 'A pleasant, focused writing experience based on markdown') is a prime example of a slick writing app that has adopted it to great success.

So that ‚Äôs Markdown, MD! [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/ 'Markdown for the component era') is markdown with JSX support, which pretty much means you can embed React components in your posts!

But why?!

## The why

A common use-case would be to render a component for your readers to mess around with‚Ä¶ Given this whole site is using Next.js and I just brought in MDX support, I can show rather than tell:

<Demonstration />

And then even inline the code of the above component:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import cn from 'classnames'

export const Demonstration = () => {
  const [tapped, setTapped] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        'cursor-pointer p-4 rounded shadow-lg text-center transition duration-300',
        {
          'bg-teal-200 text-teal-900': tapped,
          'bg-purple-600 text-purple-100': !tapped,
        }
      )}
      onClick={() => setTapped(!tapped)}
    >
      ü§ú Tap this React Component ü§õ
    </div>
  )
}
```

Isn‚Äôt that cool?!

![that IS cool](https://media.giphy.com/media/vEgtLzJo8n7qg/giphy.gif 'that IS cool')

And if you think it‚Äôs cool enough to bring in your own Next.js blog, well, you‚Äôre in luck, as the next section is‚Ä¶

## The how

### Config

The library we‚Äôll be using is [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced 'A Next.js plugin that enables MDX pages, layouts, and front matter'). It is not the [official plugin by the Nextjs team](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/packages/next-mdx 'made by the next team'), which is workable but has you jumping through hoops to make a ‚Äúblog index‚Äù page with all your posts, and to get front-matter support.

**Front-matter** is useful metadata you may put at the front of your `.mdx` files and use for things like titles, or tags, or thumbnails and summaries for social share cards.

So first step is to bring that library in!

```bash
yarn add next-mdx-enhanced
```

The plugin uses an `.mdx-data` directory for caching, so let‚Äôs add it to our `.gitignore` at this point.

Since I‚Äôm putting code snippets in my markdown, and if you‚Äôre thinking of using MDX you probably will be too, let‚Äôs bring in a library that adds classes to style those snippets nicely! I went with [rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism 'highlight code blocks in HTML with Prism'):

```bash
yarn add @mapbox/rehype-prism
```

Our goal with those two libraries is to initialise the `Next.js` plugin that will sort mdx out for us. In our code we‚Äôll do something like:

```js
const rehypePrism = require('@mapbox/rehype-prism')

const mdx = require('next-mdx-enhanced')({
  defaultLayout: true,
  fileExtensions: ['mdx', 'md'],
  rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
})
```

Depending on how you‚Äôve set up your `Next.js` site, you may or may not have a `next.config.js` at the root of your repository. If you **do**, you will need to pipe that `const mdx` to your existing configuration. If you **do not**, just create an empty file and paste the below.

In either case, I do suggest adding one more library, one that makes using multiple plugins with `Next.js` much easier. It‚Äôs no worse when you‚Äôre using only one, but the moment you use _more than one_, it really helps keep things readable. So let‚Äôs bring in [next-compose-plugins](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-compose-plugins 'a cleaner API for enabling and configuring plugins for next.js'):

```bash
yarn add next-compose-plugins
```

And here‚Äôs how our complete `next.config.js` may look like:

```js
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')
const rehypePrism = require('@mapbox/rehype-prism')

const mdx = require('next-mdx-enhanced')({
  defaultLayout: true,
  fileExtensions: ['mdx', 'md'],
  rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
})

// you may tweak other base Next options in this object
// we are using it to tell Next to also handle .md and .mdx files
const nextConfig = { pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mdx', 'md'] }

module.exports = withPlugins(
  [
    mdx,
    // you may add more plugins, and their configs, to this array
  ],
  nextConfig
)
```

### Content

The config above gets us most of the way there, but of course now we need some MDX to render! So let‚Äôs create an `.mdx` file!

It may be anywhere inside our `pages` directory and `Next.js` will resolve it as it would a ‚Äúregular‚Äù javascript/typescript file. I‚Äôve created this `pages/blog/mdx-ftw.mdx` file, and of course the name content could be anything adhering to the format, but feel free to copy & paste the below:

````md

title: MDX FTW
timestamp: 1587386236000
snippet: I got React components to render in my blogposts, and I love it
---

import { Demonstration } from '../../components/blog/Demonstration'

It means two big things:

## I can render React Components

<Demonstration />

## I can render code blocks nicely

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const regularStyles = {
  backgroundColor: '#40C9A2',
  color: '#E5F9E0',
}
const tappedStyles = {
  backgroundColor: '#E5F9E0',
  color: '#40C9A2',
}

export const Demonstration = () => {
  const [tapped, setTapped] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div
      style={tapped ? tappedStyles : regularStyles}
      onClick={() => setTapped(!tapped)}
    >
      ü§ú Tap this React Component ü§õ
    </div>
  )
}
```
````

The properties between the `---`s, the front-matter, can be anything you‚Äôd want to use in your layout file; their names have no special significance.

Your `import`s should resolve to components relative to the `.mdx` file, as you might expect! I prefer putting all components that are just used in my blog section in `components/blog`, so for this example I created a `components/blog/Demonstration.tsx` file, which contains what is also in the code block after it!

With those two files set, you might expect navigating to `/blog/mdx-ftw` would **just work**, but we have one more step: we have to create our default layout!

### Layout

When I said the front-matter property names have no special significance it was only _mostly_ true. There is one that does mean something by default to `next-mdx-enhanced`: `layout`. You may use it to specify which layout the mdx content should be nested in, so you may have a `layouts/docs` and a `layout/blog`, and even a `layout/your-wildest-dreams` according to the occasion.

In our case, we‚Äôve also passed the `defaultLayout: true` in the plugin config before, so instead of specifying the layout on every blogpost, we may just create a `layouts/index.tsx` that everything will be falling back to when there is no `layout` property in the front-matter. So let‚Äôs create that file!

```tsx
import React, { ReactNode } from 'react'
import cn from 'classnames'

type FrontMatter = {
  title: string
  snippet: string
}

export default ({ title, snippet }: FrontMatter) => ({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactNode
}) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{snippet}</p>
    <section>{children}</section>
  </div>
)
```

It‚Äôs somewhat funky, as the default export has to be a Higher Order Component type of thing, which is soooo 2018; but hopefully it makes some sense: The first method takes all the properties in the front-matter as an argument, and the second has all of the parsed mdx, everything after the front-matter, as `children`.

At this point, navigating to `/blog/mdx-ftw` will work, check it out!

![it worked!](https://media.giphy.com/media/d2Z4rTi11c9LRita/giphy.gif 'it worked!')

Great job!

### Styling

The mdx content will be there, it will have correctly been transformed to the equivalent html, but, according to how you‚Äôve set up your styles, it might be looking a bit‚Ä¶ plain. I know I always declare a ‚Äústyle reset‚Äù at the start of all of my apps, so headers are indistinguishable from paragraphs for example, unless I explicitly style them. This helps me keep an important habit, using different html tags for semantics, not for styling!

So how _do we_ explicitly style the mdx output?

We could configure the plugin with a map for the components to use in each case: give it a Styled Component to use for `p`s, a regular component with some css classes from [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'a utility-first CSS framework') to use for `h2`s, anything we‚Äôd like.

Or we could do it with CSS modules! Nothing wrong with any approach, but this is the one I find to be the most straightforward. So let‚Äôs create a `layouts/mdx.module.css` that looks something like this:

```css
.container > *,
.container section > * {
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.container h1 {
  font-size: 2.25rem;
}

.container h2 {
  font-size: 1.875rem;
}

/* Add your own styles as you fancy them */
```

And let‚Äôs import it in our layout file:

```tsx
import React, { ReactNode } from 'react'

import styles from './mdx.module.css'

// ...

=> (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{snippet}</p>
    <section>{children}</section>
  </div>
)

```

This should make our post easier to read! How about we make it a bit more‚Ä¶ **shareable**, by tweaking its metadata?

### Metadata

For this I‚Äôm using yet another third party library, [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo 'manage your SEO easily in Next.js projects'), as it does take care of a lot of the boilerplate needed to have things like Open Graph attributes that get you pretty cards when sharing on social media. Let‚Äôs add it to our project with:

```bash
yarn add next-seo
```

And amend `/blog/mdx-ftw.mdx` to use it:

```tsx
import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo'

// ...

export default ({ title, snippet }: FrontMatter) => ({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactNode
}) => (
  <>
    <NextSeo title={title} description={snippet} />
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{snippet}</p>
      <section>{children}</section>
    </div>
  </>
)
```

An image is worth a thousand words, so how would we go about configuring a bespoke image to show depending on the article? I propose nesting all of the blog images into `components/blog/images` and creating a `components/blog/FeaturedImage.tsx` component that looks like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo'

import mdxFtw from './images/mdx-ftw.jpg'
import { rootUrl } from '../../lib/constants'

const titlesToImages = {
  'MDX FTW': mdxFtw,
}

type Props = {
  title: string
}

export const FeaturedImage = ({ title }: Props) => {
  const imageSrc = titlesToImages[title]

  return imageSrc ? (
    <>
      <NextSeo
        openGraph={{
          images: [
            {
              url: `${rootUrl}${imageSrc}`,
              width: 2048,
              height: 1152,
              alt: `Featured image for ${title}`,
            },
          ],
        }}
        twitter={{
          handle: '@aTwitterHandle',
          cardType: 'summary_large_image',
        }}
      />
      <img src={imageSrc} />
    </>
  ) : null
}
```

`rootUrl` must equal to the root of wherever your blog gets deployed to; unfortunately these things will not work with relative urls.

That `titlesToImages` map needs to be updated manually with every new post, a nice thing to optimise once you‚Äôve got more than a handful! I‚Äôm conscious of the length of this article, so I will simply point to [a babel plugin for glob imports](a%20babel%20plugin%20for%20glob%20imports "it's called "babel-plugin-import-glob-array""); please do let me know and I‚Äôll to go into further detail.

Glob imports would also help us get all of our posts from the `pages/blog` directory, if we wanted a page that lists all of them; which **we do** but we‚Äôll make do with the manual approach in the next section. Before that, let‚Äôs not forget to render our new component in `layouts/index.tsx`!

```tsx
import { FeaturedImage } from '../components/blog/FeaturedImage'

// ...

=> (
  <>
    <NextSeo title={title} description={snippet} />
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{snippet}</p>
      <FeaturedImage title={title} />
      <section>{children}</section>
    </div>
  </>
)
```

Should work a treat, and that‚Äôs the last we‚Äôll be messing with these files!

But even though we‚Äôve set up the posts to render for their appropriate URLs, you may only navigate to them directly, only if you know those URL! So let‚Äôs finish strong by scaffolding an index page that can navigate to all of them!

### Creating a blog index

Having `/blog` resolve to something is done via the common Next.js way: by defining a `pages/blog/index.tsx` which has a React component as its default export.

`next-mdx-enhanced` gives us a `__resourcePath` along with the front-matter it parses, which we‚Äôll use to link to the blog posts.

Given those two pieces of knowledge, let‚Äôs create a `pages/blog/index.tsx` that looks like this:

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'

import { frontMatter as mdxFtw } from './mdx-ftw.mdx'

const pages = [mdxFtw]

const formatPath = (p: string) => p.replace(/\.mdx$/, '')

const BlogIndex = () => (
  <>
    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <ul>
      {pages.map((page) => (
        <li key={page.__resourcePath}>
          <Link href={formatPath(page.__resourcePath)}>
            <a>
              <h2>{page.title}</h2>
              <p>{page.snippet}</p>
            </a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </>
)

export default BlogIndex
```

This _would have worked_, if Typescript had any idea how our current setup resolves `.mdx` files! We have to clarify by declaring the `*.mdx` module somewhere. I‚Äôve setup my `tsconfig.json` to include my `global.d.ts` file in the root, where I also specify what `.svg` and `.jpg` imports resolve to, so this is where I‚Äôll be adding this snippet:

```ts
declare module '*.mdx' {
  import { ReactNode } from 'react'

  export const frontMatter: {
    title: string
    snippet: string
    timestamp: number
    __resourcePath: string
    // type additional properties according to
    // the front-matter you define
  }

  const component: ReactNode
  export default ReactNode
}
```

After that, Typescript will be happy, the code will transpile, and navigating to `/blog` will give us a list of all of our MDX pages. Yep, all one of ‚Äúthem‚Äù, and clicking on ‚Äúthem‚Äù will get us to the complete article!

Again, have a look at [babel-plugin-import-glob-array](https://github.com/jescalan/babel-plugin-import-glob-array 'import many files using glob pattern matching') if you don‚Äôt fancy updating that `pages` array manually, or let me know and I‚Äôll follow up this post with an explanation of how to set that up.

More important at this point would be to style those pages nicely and, hey, how about writing more posts?

But before doing either, make sure to pat yourself in the back: we did it, we set up MDX in our Next.js app! üëèüèºü•≥üéâ
